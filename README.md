The LinkedIn posts analytics dashboard tells us about which technology or field  is trending in LinkedIn.
To represent this, we have used four graphs to give a clear detail. A bar graph, line graph, Area graph and a Pie chart.

To use the dashboard follow the steps

Step 1: Create a new folder in your PC. Then run the following command: git clone https://github.com/yatinlakkaraju123/social-media-analytics-dashboard-for-deployment.git

Step 2: Create a virtual environment using the following command: python -m venv .venv  It will create a virtual environment named .venv.

Step 3: activate the virtual environment. You can use cd .venv/Scripts and then run command ./activate. It will activate the virtual environment.

Step 4: Install all the python packages from requirements.txt using command  pip install -r requirements.txt
